#
# Define the fields to cluster entities on and the order to apply clustering
#  * fields either specify an influent FL_PROPERTYTAG name or a field name
#    fields will be matched in that order and first matched is used
#  * multiple fields are delimited by commas
#  * label features by default use a fast fingerprint clustering method similar to the methods found 
#    in OpenRefine (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth). To switch to 
#    exact match use the "categorical" field type instead (e.g. TYPE:categorical) 
#    to instead cluster using edit distance append ":fuzzy" to the field type (e.g. LABEL:label:fuzzy)
#  * Format is <FL_PROPERTYTAG | FIELDNAME>:<FIELD TYPE>
#
# Field types supported are:
#  geo 			- bins entities first by continent, region, country and clusters by lat/lon if present 
#  categorical 	- bins entities by categorical value (must be a string value for this field)
#  label 		- clusters entities first by alpha then using fuzzy string clustering
#  numeric		- bins entities by numeric value into X bins.  Specify the tolerance for binning by appending ":K" 
#                 where K is a decimal [0, infinity) indicating roughly the radius of each bin (default is 100) 
#				  This parameter should be tuned to the data for best results.
#  topic		- bins entities by topic distribution property into X bins.  Specify the tolerance for binning by 
#                 appending ":K" where K is a decimal [0, 1] indicating roughly how similar entity topics need to be
#                 in order for them to be clustered together, where 0 means exactly the same and 1 mean completely different (default is 0.5)
#                 This parameter should be tuned to the data for best results. 
#
# For reference the valid FL_PROPERTYTAGS are: 
#   ID, TYPE, NAME, LABEL, STAT, TEXT, STATUS, GEO, DATE, AMOUNT, COUNT, USD, DURATION, TOPIC
#    
# Default setting is
# entity.clusterer.clusterfields = TYPE:categorical,GEO:geo,LABEL:label
# 
entity.clusterer.clusterfields = CustomerType:categorical,AccountClass:categorical,CustomerState:categorical,CustomerCity:categorical


#
# Define distribution properties of clusters.  Each property is a distribution of the corresponding 
# entity properties in the cluster.
#  * fields either specify an influent FL_PROPERTYTAG name or a field name
#    fields will be matched in that order and first matched is used
#  * multiple fields are delimited by commas
#  * Format is <FL_PROPERTYTAG | FIELDNAME>:<CLUSTER FIELDNAME>:<true | false> 
#    where the true or false component is optional and indicates whether to normalize the distribution to sum to 1.0 (default is false)
#  * The resulting cluster property will be a distribution range with type and tag inherited from the entities
#  * NOTE: This currently only supports SingleRange fields of type String, FL_GeoData and DistributionRange fields 
#          of type FL_TOPIC - all others are ignored
# 
# Default setting is
# entity.clusterer.clusterfields = TYPE:type-dist,GEO:location-dist

# specify the maximum number of members each leaf clusters can contain
# clusters will be split into sub-clusters until no leaf cluster contains more than max number of members
